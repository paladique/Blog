title: About

This is an [open source](https://github.com/paladique/blog) blog about code and projects. Send questions or corrections [in an Issue](https://github.com/paladique/Blog/issues/new).
It was created with [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) and the [cactus dark](https://github.com/probberechts/cactus-dark) theme.

 I tinkered with HTML and CSS in my younger years through GeoCities, MySpace, and LiveJournal. I went to college to achieve my childhood dream of becoming a meteorologist. But a class on Perl convinced me to change my major to software engineering.

I've been in tech since fall of 2009, starting as an part-time dev intern and currently working in developer relations. Most of my work has been done in C# or JavaScript.
