I'm [Jasmine](http://jasminegreenaway.com). I tinkered with HTML and CSS in my younger years through Geocities, MySpace, and LiveJournal. I went to college to achieve my childhood dream of becoming a meteorologist. However, boredom with the subject, fear of ending up on tv instead of a research facility, and a class on Perl convinced me to change my major to software engineering.

I've shipped production code since the fall of 2009, starting as an part-time intern. That was [<span id="y"></span>](https://github.com/paladique/Blog/blob/master/themes/cactus-dark/source/js/main.js#L24) years ago.
I write C# the majority of the time, but a little JS happens every once in a while.
